# Returns-Open-Source-Calculators
Return Protocol estimates the carbon intensity of Ethereum, Bitcoin, and many Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains. In theory understanding the carbon intensity of blockchains is relatively straightforward; however, in practice the accuracy and robustness of each calculation is muddied by the availability and quality of necessary information. While Return Protocol does its best to calculate the carbon footprint of each user, the precision of each calculation will vary depending on the chain. 
The methodology below outlines the information needed to calculate a blockchainâ€™s carbon footprint, along with the necessary assumptions made where information was poor or unavailable. It also examines the relevant challenges and steps taken with respect to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other PoS chains. As the Web3 space evolves and more data becomes available, these calculators will be updated with the most accurate and up-to-date information.
